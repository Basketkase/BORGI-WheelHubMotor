*Make sure to run the motor in a security housing only, to prevent any injury or damage to your property!*

*You should not run the motor higher than 10000 rpm!!! Letting it spin faster is very dangerous and can result in severe injury!*

## What is the BORGI Hubmotor?

The BORGI Hubmotor is an opensource, axial-flux, pancake style wheel-hub motor which you can drop in between your cars rims and wheelaxle.

In theory you can convert your car from gasoline or diesel to electric hybrid or 100% electric with it.

## What are the specs?

The construction is quite simple so that you can build it yourself with common fabrication tools which you can find in any fablab.

It consists of a 3D-Printed polymer stator which houses the electromagnetic coils, two aluminum rotor discs with neodymium magnets and some nuts and bolts.

It incorporates a VAG OE-1T0598611 Wheelhub-bearing which is present in quite some VW, AUDI, SKODA & SEAT cars. It's probably easy to adapt it to other kind of wheelhubs/wheelbearings.

The outer diameter of the motor should be compatible with 18" rims. The design is adaptable to other rim diameters.

It weighs approx. 15kg.

Its not fully tested yet but we have run it with 20KW of power and did not notice any significant heat buildup. Our guesstimate is that you can probably run it upto 60KW. When you run it with no load, with 20kw it reaches 10000rpm quick.
You should not run it higher than 10000 rpm!!! Letting it spin faster is very dangerous and can result in severe injury in case it breaks apart! Make sure to run the motor in a security housing only to prevent any injury or damage to your property!
If you pump more energy through it make sure there is an appropriate counter force to keep the rpm below 10000 rpm!

## What kind of motor controller does it work with

In theory any kind of dc-motorcontroller should be able to drive it, yet because of its axial flux topology we are still investigating the best way to drive the motor.
We will update this readme with more infos on the controller soon.
